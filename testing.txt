Testing
=======

1. Validated all 4 html pages (blog, checkout, dogs, index) on HTML5 validator, https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea

2. Validated style.css on CSS validator, http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input

3. Tested the site in 3 browsers (Edge, Firefox, and Chrome) and their emulators of iPad and iPhone for responsiveness.
    * Text, controls & images are aligned.
    * Hover effects and color changes are consistent.
    * No element runs into edges of screen.
    * Horizontal bar is not visible.
    * All pages are readable.

    * Interesting finding:
     In the iPad emulator in Edge and Chrome, the mouseenter/mouseleave event in dogs.html works as expected.  In that the dog image flips horizontally, and the color of the Adopt button fades in/out.  However, this event does not work in the iPad emulator in Firefox.


Changes Made
============
1. The HTML validator identified some errors.  They are corrected accordingly.

2. The responsiveness testing identified the checkout button in the header area ran over the bottom edge when viewed in a browser with narrowed width.  This happened in all 3 browsers.  They are fixed accordingly.

3. The browser development tool identified a JavaScript error in dogs.html.  It is corrected.
